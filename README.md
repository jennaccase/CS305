Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized fianncial plans for their customers including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They wanted to modernize their operations and update the software security. 
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I did well when I was running the vulnerability assessments and finding security problems within the code. It's important to code securely so that you are able to have less problems down the line when you are working on security problems. Software security adds a lot to a company's overall wellbeing. Artemis Financial for example deals with personal customer information. If that information were to get stolen, it would ruin their reputation.
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The vulnerability assessment was helpful to leanr about different vulnerabilities in software and also how something as small as outdated add ons can affect your overall security.
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased the layers of security by adding a cipher into the code. I would use this in the future for most secure applications because it is a good way to ensure that your code is safe. 
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I made certain the code and application were functional by running them. I checked to see whether i introduced new vulnerabilities after refactoring the code by running the vulnerability test again and making sure nothing new was there.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I found stackoverflow helpful for when I had small issues that I didn't know how to resolve. 
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show that I know how to setup and use ciphers since software security is important for every application.
